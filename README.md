# Gas Phase Molecular Dynamics Simulator using Verlet Integration

A molecular dynamics program was developed to simulate atom particles in a gas phase for a university exam. Verlet
integration (Velocity Verlet) was employed to numerically integrate the Newtonâ€™s equation of motion, allowing for the calculation
of particle trajectories. The interaction between gas particles was simulated through a Lennard-Jones potential,
where every atom experience a cumulative Lennard-Jones force generated by other particles.
The program, written in FORTRAN 90, is a combination of two distinct codes. The first code MD.f90 serves
as the main program, while the second utilities.f90 comprises a set of subroutines that are invoked within the main
program.

## Folder Structure

- **input_files**: Includes sample input files. Make sure that the input file is named `input` before running the program.

- **output**: Stores all output files generated by the program for the Hydrogen and Argon gas-phase system, including energy plots and the Gnuplot code used to generate them.

## Instructions

1. Create an input file named `input` with a structure similar to the provided samples in the `input_files` folder.
2. Compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
gfortran -c utilities.f90
gfortran utilities.o MD.f90 -o MD
./MD
```
3. The results will be generated in the current folder
