# Gas Phase Molecular Dynamics Simulator using Verlet Integration

A molecular dynamics program was developed to simulate atom particles in a gas phase. Verlet
integration was employed to numerically integrate the Newtonâ€™s equation of motion, allowing for the calculation
of particle trajectories. The interaction between gas particles was simulated through a Lennard-Jones potential,
where every atom experience a cumulative Lennard-Jones force generated by other particles.
The program, written in FORTRAN 90, is a combination of two distinct codes. The first code MD.f90 serves
as the main program, while the second utilities.f90 comprises a set of subroutines that are invoked within the main
program.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:
```bash
gfortran -c utilities.f90
gfortran utilities.o MD.f90 -o MD
./MD
```
